### Executive Summary


### Database Administrator Responsibilities 

  The primary responsibilities of a Database Administrator is to create, maintain, and protect a database for the organization that employed the individual. This normally entails designing a database from scratch or modifying an existing database by organizing the data into smaller, managable tables of information that are then linked together by primary and foreign keys. A well organized database can help prevent duplicate data in the system. 
  
  Administrators are also resposible for securing the database from internal and external threats, such as power outages or viruses. This may be accomplished by creating backups of the database on a regular interval. Additionally, Database Administrators are able to give users specific permissions that influence what they are able to do with the data in the system (i.e. create new tables).
  
  Finally, the Database Administrator must maintain the database so it remains organized and free of duplicate information. The administrator can use a variety of logs to determine how to alter the database to improve functionality and performance, as well as address errors. Logs are discussed in the following section.
