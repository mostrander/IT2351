### Creating a Database from a Script

I loaded the script into SQL Workbench by going to File|Open SQL Script|Folder name|file name. Basically, I selected the script file I wanted to open from the folder that I saved it in. After that I edited the database name in the script file to what I wanted, saved, and hit the run button to tell the program to execute the script.

### Retrieving Data From Two or More Tables

Inner joins are designed to retrieve corresponding data from two or more tables using primary and foeign keys that match specified criteria. Outer joins, on the other hand, returns all of the data from one table in the join regardless of whether the criteria is met. The best way to explain the two is to consider how both join types relate to a Venn Diagram: An inner join represents the middle common ground of the Venn Diagram where the two tables share, while the separate sections of the Venn Diagram that would represent the individual tables would correspond with the outer join because outer joins are designed to include data from both tables, as well as any data from the specified table regardless of meeting conditions.
