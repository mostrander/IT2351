### Executive Summary

In this first lab assignment I will provide several images of changes I make to a prebuilt SQL script, as well as some of the actual code snippets I created to make the changes. The purpose of this lab is to beginning using SQL and become familiar with the commands. 

### Creating a Database from a Script

I loaded the script into SQL Workbench by going to File|Open SQL Script|Folder name|file name. Basically, I selected the script file I wanted to open from the folder that I saved it in. After that I edited the database name in the script file to what I wanted, saved, and hit the run button to tell the program to execute the script.

### Retrieving Data From Two or More Tables

Inner joins are designed to retrieve corresponding data from two or more tables using primary and foeign keys that match specified criteria. Outer joins, on the other hand, returns all of the data from one table in the join regardless of whether the criteria is met. The best way to explain the two is to consider how both join types relate to a Venn Diagram: An inner join represents the middle common ground of the Venn Diagram where the two tables share, while the separate sections of the Venn Diagram that would represent the individual tables would correspond with the outer join because outer joins are designed to include data from both tables, as well as any data from the specified table regardless of meeting conditions.

### Conclusion

Throughout this lab project I have provided several images showing the changes I made to the prebuilt database, which includes the SQL commands I used to make the changes and the results. I have also included a few snippets of SQL code that I used to make some of the changes. 

Overall, I feel I learned a great deal from this first project and I found it fun to experiment with the SQL code.
