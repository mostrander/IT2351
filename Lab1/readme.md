### Creating a Database from a Script

I loaded the script into SQL Workbench by going to File|Open SQL Script|Folder name|file name. Basically, I selected the script file I wanted to open from the folder that I saved it in. After that I edited the database name in the script file to what I wanted, saved, and hit the run button to tell the program to execute the script.
